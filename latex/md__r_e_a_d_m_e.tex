\subsection*{Submodule / Course\-Lib}

Submodule for Course\-Lib is currently configured to use ssh. If you haven't yet setup an ssh-\/key. Go do it at \href{https://course-gitlab.tuni.fi/profile/keys}{\tt https\-://course-\/gitlab.\-tuni.\-fi/profile/keys}

The page contains also instructions for generating and using existing ssh-\/keys.

Don't change anything in Course\-Lib ( You won't be able to submit changes made in it )

If you find any bugs and/or missing features you can report them in Git\-Lab \href{https://course-gitlab.tuni.fi/tie-0240x-ohjelmointi-3-programming-3_independent_2021/course/-/issues}{\tt https\-://course-\/gitlab.\-tuni.\-fi/tie-\/0240x-\/ohjelmointi-\/3-\/programming-\/3\-\_\-independent\-\_\-2021/course/-\//issues}

\subsection*{Doxygen documentation}

No Doxyfile is provided with the project, but you may generate it using doxygen or doxywizard. For example, \char`\"{}doxygen -\/g\char`\"{} should generate configuration file named Doxy\-File.

\subsection*{Other notes}

You should create your own code inside your own namespace \-:) The actual R\-E\-A\-D\-M\-E mentioned in project description has been lost to the bit space. If you have any questions, feel free to contact the staff, preferably through \href{mailto:prog3@tuni.fi}{\tt prog3@tuni.\-fi} or the prog3 teams channel.
