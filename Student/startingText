Space... Space never changes...

Thousands of years have passed since humanity reached for the stars beyond. Even after leaving planet Earth, mankind has reigned kingdom to keep peace in the final frontier.

But now Prog-Thre Proyect, ruler of SUSIPALATSI and governor of Earth has passed and the young heir is not yet of age.
It is up to the Council of United Celestial Kingdoms in Space to choose a new ruler for planet Earth and perhaps even the entire galaxy...

As a dedicated member of the council you consider yourself fit for the throne, so now it is up to you to gain enough trust from your associates from various planets to claim the throne.

Use influence and power to receive their endorsement and become the new ruler of... SUSIPALATSI
